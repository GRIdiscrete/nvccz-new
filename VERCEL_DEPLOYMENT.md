# Deploying to Vercel

This document provides instructions for deploying the NVCCZ Financial Hub application to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

1. A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup)
2. Your code pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect Your Repository to Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Click "Add New..." → "Project"
3. Import your Git repository
4. Select the repository containing your Next.js project

### 2. Configure Project Settings

Vercel will automatically detect that this is a Next.js project and pre-fill most settings:

- **Framework Preset**: Next.js
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (default)
- **Output Directory**: `.next` (default)
- **Install Command**: `npm install` (default)

### 3. Environment Variables

This project doesn't require any environment variables for basic functionality. If you need to add environment variables in the future, you can do so in the Vercel dashboard under "Project Settings" → "Environment Variables".

### 4. Deploy

Click "Deploy" and Vercel will build and deploy your project.

## Post-Deployment

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Settings" → "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain and follow the instructions to configure DNS

### Monitoring

1. Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Analytics" to monitor performance
3. Click "Logs" to view deployment and runtime logs

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Check the build logs for errors
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
3. Verify that your Next.js configuration is compatible with Vercel
4. Check that your API routes are working correctly

## Optimizations

For better performance on Vercel:

1. Use Vercel's Edge Network for caching
2. Implement proper image optimization
3. Use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for dynamic content
4. Configure proper caching headers for API routes

## Continuous Deployment

Vercel automatically deploys when you push changes to your repository. You can configure preview deployments for pull requests in the Vercel dashboard under "Settings" → "Git".
